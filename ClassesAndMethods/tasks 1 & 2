1. Create class named Student with following public properties: 

 

- name 

- fNumber 

 

and methods: 

 

- takeExam() 

 

This method should implement logic for printing out the following message: "Taking exam". 

 

 

Note: name and fNumber are assigned in class constructor. 

 

2. Create new class University and add boolean static method to check if the student year has started. 


3. Create two classes: 

 

- Mathematician 

 

Add property certification to this class. 

 

- Athlete 

 

 

4. These two classes should inherit Student class. 

 

 

5. Update Student class by adding new property attendance (заверка). Consider the best type for this property. 


using System;

namespace StaticVarApplication
{
    class Student
    {
        public string name;
        public string fName;
        public bool zaverka;

        public static void takeExam(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Taking exam");
        }

        class University
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                YesOrNo();
            }
            public static bool YesOrNo()
            {
                bool hasStarted = true;
                Console.WriteLine("Has the year started?");
                string answer = Console.ReadLine();
                switch (answer)
                {
                    case "Yes":
                        Console.WriteLine("The year has started");
                        hasStarted = true;
                        break;
                    case "No":
                        Console.WriteLine("The year has not started");
                        hasStarted = false;
                        break;

                }
                return hasStarted;
            }
        }

        public class Mathematician : Student
        {

        }

        public class Athlete : Student 
        {

        }
    }
}
