Approach 1:I would follow the river down or up to see if there is anything(rocks that are big enough to stick out or a place where the water is shallow)I can to 
use as a bridge.

Approach 2:Although the chances are very low, I would look for a log or something long and make myself a bridge.

Approach 3:If I came here without having to cross the river there has got to be some other way so I would go back and use anything I got to leave clues behind 
so I won't get lost again.

Approach 4:I would try and climb on a tree as high as possible and check if I can see anything that would help me.

Approach 5:If there isn't any other way to cross the river,the only thing that's left is to find shelter,food,water and I would try and learn how to swim
(even if I have to spend several days doing it).
