Boundary values test cases:
-Lower boundary:test with numbers 9/10/11.
-Upper boundary:test with numbers 99/100/101.
-A number somewhere in the middle:63/64. 

Equivalence partitioning:
-Group 1:Any number less the 10:0/5/6
-Group 2:Any number between 10 and 99:20/37/78
-Group 3:Any number greater than 99:110/105/120/1000
