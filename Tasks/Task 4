I would check to see if the cable would cause sparkling upon plugging it.
Then, I would do a sanity test to see if the cable works by simply checking if the screen si visible.
Then, I would check to see if the picture of the screen is blurry or low quality.
Finally, I would try and hack using the HDMI cable to check if it's safe to use.
